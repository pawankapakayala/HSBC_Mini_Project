# HSBC – Hostel Student Banking Card (C++ Mini Project)

HSBC (Hostel Student Banking Card) is a **C++ console-based mini project** designed to simulate a **cashless transaction system for hostel students**.  
The system allows students to use a virtual card for purchases at hostel facilities such as bakeries, stationery stores, and essential item counters.

This project was developed as part of academic coursework to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++** and real-world problem modeling.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In hostel environments, handling cash for small daily transactions can be inconvenient and difficult to track.  
There is a need for a **simple, secure, and centralized system** to manage student spending within the hostel premises.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The HSBC system provides:
- A **student-based banking card system**
- Balance management and transaction tracking
- Controlled spending within hostel facilities

The project focuses on **clarity of logic, OOP principles, and modular design**, making it suitable for learning and academic evaluation.
